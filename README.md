# MagPiDownloader

Here are two scripts I wrote in my spare time to download all of the magpi issues from raspberrypi.org.

Separate versions exist for python 3.5 and python 2.7

Simply run the file in your ide of choice or via the commandline.
A prompt will appear to specify the download location.

As of 13-Dec-2016 there are 75 issues, including the translated versions, EduEditions, Project books, and essentials.
The script takes ~10 minutes to complete, depending on download speeds.
